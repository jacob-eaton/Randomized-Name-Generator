# Randomized Name Generator

This is a fantasy name generator that I built for DnD. The generator randomly
combines first names with surnames based on chosen race and gender. First names
are either selected from a list or are randomly assembled from syllable building
blocks.

This name generator was written about on my blog [here](https://www.jacobeaton.com/2021/05/17/Randomized-Name-Generator.html).
